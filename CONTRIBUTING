# Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing to this project. If you don't want to contribute code, you can always [open an issue](https://github.com/The-SourceCode/Open-SourceBot/issues/new) and share your ideas or report bugs/typos.

## How to contribute
Fork the repository (https://github.com/The-SourceCode/Open-SourceBot/fork)

Clone your fork
```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/repository
```

Create your feature branch including the category it fits into (categories on preferences page)
```sh
git checkout -b {category}-{feature}/fooBar
```

Write your changes and test they work fully

Commit your changes
```sh
git commit -m "add some foobar"
```

Push to the new branch
```sh
git push origin feature/foobar
```

Create a new pull request (https://github.com/castyte/osssettings/compare)
In the pull request body include:
- Features added along with the categories
- Details about the test device(s) you used
- Other features which may cause this feature to not function (eg. a feature which disables the control center and another that makes it smaller)

## Requirements
There are a couple requirements that need to be met before a pull request can be accepted.

- The feature must be tested and confirmed to work
- If the feature causes another feature to not function properly you must make sure only one can be enabled at once and a message about it is included in the preferences.
- Code needs to have documentation where necessary. If we believe the documentation is not clear enough, we will let you know on the pull request.
- Features must not modify App Store applicatons, or include materials which may be deemed illegal in the United States or the United Kingdom
- Maintainers need to review and approve the changes before a pull request can be merged.
- No commits to the master branch should be made. All changes should be made through pull requests.

If you have any questions about these requirements, feel free to ask.
