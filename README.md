##### OSS Settings is a project designed to gather as many settings as possible which may be useful to a user on jailbroken iOS into one package, similar to Springtomize or MiscSettings. OSS Settings is different as the project is fully open-source under the GPL-3.0 licence, and anyone can contribute.
